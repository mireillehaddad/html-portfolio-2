<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I have over 5 years of expertise in the field of applied mathematics. I worked on different projects for designing numerical algorithms for multiphase fluids and solidification process. Before relocating to Canada, I worked as a data scientist at Data-Pop Alliance, a think tank founded out of Harvard and MIT. I've hands on experience with projects that employ AI and Big Data for good. I worked on projects with UNICEF to map violence against children and youth in Haiti and with UNDP to use Big Data for SDGs in Morocco (mental health monitoring and suicidal rate estimation). I have strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, as well as comprehensive knowledge of applied mathematics and statistics. I am self-disciplined and motivated, and eager to learn more about mathematical applications.
